# Project Digit Sum

`2^15 = 32768` and the sum of its digits is `3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26`.

Without using external libraries or valuable type similar to bigInt, calculate the sum of the digits of the number `2^1000` (Answer is `1366`) (Hint: Use `Array` or `String`).

Bonus: Similarly calculate the sum of the digits of the number `99999^1000` (Answer is `22383`)?

Tip: There are many was to do this. Such as recursion vs for loop
